          A summary view is also available by clicking the dashboard button
          (<i class="fa fa-dashboard"></i>).
          Click on the name of a virtual machine to see its connection

          Important or frequently used machines can be pinned by the

          The search field shows results incrementally, and submitting (‚èé)

          of the machine and a summary about how you can
          <strong>connect</strong> to the
          machine.
          In the middle there is a tabbed pane, which contains details about
          the machine in categories.

          The tool buttons are color coded by their effect, and enabled/disabled

          The recommended operation is always the biggest tool button with
          the name displayed.
          You can click on them as the confirmation dialog explains in

          We strongly advise to add a description to make the work of the
          cloud administrators easier in case of maintenance.
          Here is a summary about the <strong>expiration times</strong> as
          well. Each virtual machine has a deadline for suspending and
          destroying based on predefined leases. With the renew button you
          can reset the counters. Of course you will get a notification if
